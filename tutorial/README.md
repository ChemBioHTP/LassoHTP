For this tutorial, we will construct the RGD mutant of microcin J25 (PDBID 2mmw).
In the /initial_files folder, transfer input.py to the LassoHTP home directory.
You will find the input sequence of the lasso peptide in mcc_J25.fasta.
The ring size of microcin J25 is 8 and the upper plug position is 11.

The initial scaffold generated by LassoHTP will be 8e_11_2.pdb.
8e_11_2_A1G... .pdb is the resulting file after mutation.
Without minimization, the structure will appear very strained. Minimization, which is 
automated by the workflow, will fix this and initiate the subsequent MD steps.
You can see an example of the mutated, minimized structure in the initial_files folder by using

ambpdb -p 8e_11_2_A1G*.prmtop -c 8e_11_2_A1G*.inpcrd

Initiate the workflow using python input.py. For the sake of tutorial
brevity, the initial setting for production MD is 1 ns. Using LassoHTP with
GPU-acceleration will make short work of this simulation. Feel free to 
increase the number of MD steps for a longer simulation.
