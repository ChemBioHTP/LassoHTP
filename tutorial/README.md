For this tutorial, we will construct the RGD mutant of microcin J25 (PDBID 2mmw).

Go to the /initial_files directory `cd tutorial/initial_files/`, copy input.py to the LassoHTP home directory `cp input.py ../..`. You will find the input sequence of the lasso peptide in mcc_J25.fasta under the tutorial/ directory. The ring size of microcin J25 is 8 and the upper plug position is 11.

Under the initial_files/ directory, the initial scaffold generated by LassoHTP will be 8e_11_2.pdb. 8e_11_2_A1G* is the resulting file after mutation. Without minimization, the structure will appear very strained. Minimization, which is automated by the workflow in input.py, will fix this and initiate the subsequent MD steps. You can visulize an example PDB file of the mutated, minimized structure with solvent in the initial_files/ directory using `ambpdb -p 8e_11_2_AA1G*.prmtop -c 8e_11_2_AA1G*.inpcrd > 8e_11_2_min.pdb`.

Under the home directory of LassoHTP, initiate the workflow using `python input.py`. For the sake of tutorial brevity, the heat, equilibration, and production MD are 10000, 2000, and 2000 steps, respectively. With this setup, input.py will run for around 30 minutes on one Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5-2440 0 @ 2.40GHz CPU.

Using LassoHTP with GPU-acceleration will make short work of this simulation. Feel free to increase the number of MD steps for a longer simulation.
