# LassoHTP
LassoHTP is a computational tool geared towards lasso peptide design and discovery. Major functionalities include the high throughput (i.e. HTP) construction of lasso peptides as well as HTP molecular dynamics simulations to predict lasso peptide thermodynamic parameters.

/scaffold contains three demo scaffolds, constructed with our protocol. Use a visualizer such as PyMOL to observe
the scaffold.
